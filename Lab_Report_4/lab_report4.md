# Lab Report 4 - Doing it All from the Command Line

In this lab report, I will demonstrate how I used vim in the lab session as an exercise on improving my skill to use vim more effectively and quickly. I will be showing a set of tasks and provide screenshots and what keys I press for me to do each of them.

## Preparation and Pre-Setup
Before starting the timer, I do these pre-tasks.
1. First, I removed the folder that I used to do these tasks in during the lab session. This is done so that no tasks are skipped during this demonstration.

2. Second, I forked Professor Joe's [Sample Directory](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) that will be used to demonstrate vim with.

With these set up done, now I'm ready to start the stopwatch.

## Logging into ieng6
Logging in to the ieng6 server takes almost no time as I'm already well more than experienced in doing so through weeks of lab tasks involving doing this, coupled with the fact that I don't even need to enter my password anymore as it has already been saved through the SSH Keys task done in this week's lab. For the keys, all I did was type in `ssh` + `<space>` + `c` and then press `<tab>` and it automatically fills in my registered course ieng6 account. And then I hit enter, and then this step is done.
