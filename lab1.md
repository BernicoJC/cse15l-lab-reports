# CSE 15L Lab Report 1

Hi, my name's Bernico. This is my first ever CSE 15L lab section and I finally had several experiences dealing with tools such as ssh, file systems in terminal in general, and github (the website I'm using right now). On this page, I'm going to show a demo the experience of this lab and how to (_theoretically_) log into the UCSD ieng6 ssh account.

## Disclaimer

Before I begin, here are a couple of disclaimers about this "guide".
- I'm sure you are wondering why I put the word "theoretically" on my intro. Well, this is because, when my lab was in session, there was an issue with the ieng6 ssh server such that I couldn't log in with my course specific account. ieng6.ucsd.edu would immediately be closed by a remote host everytime I would try to log in (pictured below). As such, I will just share about what **I** did, which was mostly trying to do the same thing instructed, but using my UCSD-wide account.

- Other than that, there are some of the steps in my demo that's not the same for everyone. This might be the case since either I've already had something installed and thus didn't need to do it in the lab, or because of the aforementioned trouble with the UCSD server. In these cases, I will mention what I skipped and briefly explain how it would normally be done.
